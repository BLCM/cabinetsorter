The ModCabinet wiki exists to provide a slightly-easier way of browsing through
Borderlands 2/TPS mods, apart from digging through the somewhat-daunting main
github repo.  For information on actually building your own mods, the [BLCMods
Wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/wiki) is your best starting point.
